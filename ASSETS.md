## Audio Implementation Strategy

### Core Audio (Already Generated)
Use existing sounds from the main audio assets list above for all essential game functionality.

### Ending Audio Sequences (Using Existing Sounds)
- **Merge Ending:** `system_beep.mp3` + `whisper_ambient.mp3` + `crt_hum.mp3` (faded)
- **Refuse Ending:** `electrical_buzz.mp3` + `glitch_static.mp3` + `static_loop.mp3`
- **Delete Ending:** `glitch_static.mp3` (extended) + `whisper_ambient.mp3` (fading) + silence

### Meta & Easter Egg Audio (Using Existing Sounds)
- **Hidden Commands:** `system_beep.mp3` + `boot_sequence.mp3`
- **Fourth Wall Breaks:** `electrical_buzz.mp3`
- **Philosophical Moments:** `whisper_ambient.mp3`

### Technical Implementation Audio (Using Existing Sounds)
- **Loading/Processing:** `boot_sequence.mp3` + `static_loop.mp3` + `electrical_buzz.mp3`
- **Phase Transitions:** `electrical_buzz.mp3` (brief) → `glitch_static.mp3` → `static_loop.mp3` (intense)
- **Puzzle Audio:** `static_loop.mp3` + `electrical_buzz.mp3` + `system_beep.mp3`

### Audio Quality Specifications
- **Format:** MP3, 44.1kHz, 128kbps minimum (256kbps for voice lines)
- **Length:** Most effects 1-5 seconds, ambient tracks 30-60 seconds (seamless loops)
- **Volume:** Normalized to prevent audio spikes, with consistent levels across all files
- **Processing:** Subtle digital filtering on all sounds to maintain retro-computer aesthetic
- **Ambient sounds:** Should layer well without frequency conflicts
- **Effect sounds:** Sharp and distinct to cut through ambient audio
- **Voice processing:** Maintain clarity while adding subtle digital artifacts
- **Dynamic range:** Preserve emotional impact while maintaining consistent playback levels

### Priority Levels
- **HIGH PRIORITY:** Core audio assets (already generated) + glitch effects using existing sounds
- **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Extended ambient tracks and ELARA's emotional states
- **LOW PRIORITY:** Meta-awareness sounds and additional whisper variations

### Text Content Guidelines
- Use period-appropriate language (1980s computer terminology)
- Include technical jargon to enhance authenticity
- Gradually reveal story through fragmented information
- Create emotional connection through personal diary entries
- Maintain consistency in character voice and timeline
