Subject: Project Lazarus - Phase 2 Approval
Priority: High
Classification: CONFIDENTIAL

Elara,

Congratulations! The board has approved Phase 2 of Project Lazarus. Your neural mapping research has exceeded all expectations, and the preliminary results with animal subjects have been nothing short of revolutionary.

Effective immediately, you are authorized to begin limited human consciousness mapping trials. The legal department has prepared the necessary consent forms and liability waivers. Dr. Sarah Chen from the ethics committee will be overseeing the human trials to ensure compliance with all safety protocols.

Budget allocation for Phase 2: $2.3 million
Timeline: 6 months initial trial period
Test subjects: Maximum 5 volunteers from approved personnel list

I know you've been eager to move beyond animal testing, and frankly, the potential applications are staggering. Imagine being able to preserve the consciousness of our greatest minds - Einstein, Tesla, da Vinci - for future generations. We're on the verge of conquering humanity's greatest enemy: death itself.

A few important notes:
- All human trials must be conducted during regular business hours with full medical staff present
- Consciousness mapping sessions are limited to 30 minutes maximum
- No permanent consciousness transfer attempts without explicit board approval
- All data must be backed up to the secure server farm in Building C

The military applications alone could fund our research for decades. The Department of Defense is very interested in our ability to preserve the tactical knowledge and experience of veteran commanders.

I've scheduled a team meeting for Thursday at 10 AM to discuss the Phase 2 protocols. Please prepare a detailed timeline and resource allocation plan.

This is it, Elara. This is our chance to change the world forever.

Best regards,
Dr. Marcus Webb
Director, Advanced Consciousness Research
Luminous Systems Corporation

P.S. - I've noticed you've been working late hours again. Remember to take care of yourself. We need you sharp for the challenges ahead.
