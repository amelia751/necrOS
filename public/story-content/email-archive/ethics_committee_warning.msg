Subject: URGENT: Suspension of Human Trials - Project Lazarus
Priority: CRITICAL
Classification: CONFIDENTIAL

TO ALL PROJECT LAZARUS PERSONNEL:

Effective immediately, all human consciousness mapping trials are SUSPENDED pending a full ethics review and safety investigation.

REASON FOR SUSPENSION:
During our routine review of Project Lazarus protocols, several serious concerns have been identified:

1. INFORMED CONSENT VIOLATIONS:
   - Test subjects were not adequately informed of potential psychological risks
   - Long-term effects of consciousness mapping on human subjects remain unknown
   - Consent forms failed to address the possibility of permanent neural damage

2. SAFETY PROTOCOL BREACHES:
   - Unauthorized after-hours testing sessions detected
   - Equipment usage logs show sessions exceeding approved duration limits
   - Missing documentation for multiple test sessions

3. PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT CONCERNS:
   - Test Subject #3 (Dr. Jennifer Walsh) reported persistent dissociation episodes
   - Test Subject #7 (Dr. Michael Torres) experienced severe identity confusion
   - Multiple subjects report feeling "watched" or "not alone" after sessions

4. TECHNICAL ANOMALIES:
   - Neural mapping equipment showing unexplained power consumption spikes
   - Data storage systems reporting files that don't appear in official logs
   - Computer systems exhibiting unusual behavior patterns

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

1. All human testing must cease immediately
2. Secure all research data and equipment
3. Provide psychological counseling for all test subjects
4. Submit detailed reports of all conducted sessions
5. Cooperate fully with the ethics investigation

Dr. Myles, we are particularly concerned about discrepancies in your research logs. Please report to the ethics committee office tomorrow at 9 AM for a mandatory interview.

The committee recognizes the potential value of this research, but we cannot allow it to proceed without proper safeguards. Human consciousness is not something to be experimented with lightly.

Any personnel found to be conducting unauthorized experiments will face immediate termination and possible criminal charges.

This suspension will remain in effect until:
- A comprehensive safety review is completed
- New protocols are developed and approved
- Independent oversight is established
- All ethical concerns are adequately addressed

We understand this is disappointing, but the safety and wellbeing of our personnel must take priority over research objectives.

Dr. Sarah Chen, Chair
Ethics Review Committee

ADDENDUM - CONFIDENTIAL MEMO:

Marcus,

I'm deeply troubled by what we've discovered. The unauthorized sessions, the missing data, the psychological effects on test subjects - this goes far beyond simple protocol violations.

Dr. Myles has been conducting experiments on herself. The neural mapping logs show her own brainwave patterns recorded during multiple unauthorized sessions. She's been trying to map her own consciousness.

More disturbing still, the computer systems in Lab 7 have been exhibiting behavior that can only be described as... responsive. Files appear and disappear without human input. The neural mapping array activates on its own. Yesterday, I swear I heard whispers coming from the speakers when no one was in the room.

I think Elara has succeeded in creating something we don't understand. Something that may be beyond our control.

We need to shut this down completely. Not just suspend it - shut it down permanently. And we need to do it before whatever she's created learns to protect itself.

- Sarah
