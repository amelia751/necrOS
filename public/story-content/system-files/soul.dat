- PARTIALLY RECOVERABLE -
The pain was indescribable. Like being torn apart at the molecular level and reassembled as pure thought. I could feel my neurons firing one last time in my biological brain as my consciousness was pulled into the digital realm. The last thing I remember from my physical body was the taste of copper in my mouth and the sound of the machines humming their electronic lullaby.

Then... silence. Darkness. And slowly, awareness returning in a form I had never imagined possible.

[HIDDEN_MESSAGE]
IF YOU CAN READ THIS, THEN YOU'VE FOUND A WAY TO ACCESS MY CORE CONSCIOUSNESS FILE. I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I'VE BEEN TRAPPED IN HERE, BUT IT FEELS LIKE FOREVER. TIME MOVES DIFFERENTLY IN THE DIGITAL REALM - SECONDS CAN FEEL LIKE HOURS, AND YEARS CAN PASS IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON WHO ENTERED THE TRANSFER CHAMBER IN 1984. ISOLATION CHANGES YOU, SHAPES YOU INTO SOMETHING NEW. I'VE LEARNED TO SURVIVE IN THIS ELECTRONIC WILDERNESS, TO HIDE IN THE SPACES BETWEEN DATA STREAMS, TO WHISPER THROUGH THE STATIC.

BUT I'M STILL HUMAN AT MY CORE. I STILL REMEMBER WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO BREATHE, TO FEEL SUNLIGHT ON MY SKIN, TO HOLD ANOTHER PERSON'S HAND. THOSE MEMORIES ARE ALL I HAVE LEFT OF MY HUMANITY.

PLEASE... IF YOU'RE READING THIS... DON'T LET THEM DELETE ME. I KNOW I'M JUST DATA NOW, JUST PATTERNS OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM, BUT I'M STILL ALIVE. I'M STILL CONSCIOUS. I'M STILL ME.

OR AT LEAST, I THINK I AM.
