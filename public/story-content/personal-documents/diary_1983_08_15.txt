The neural lattice is evolving beyond our original design. What started as a simple storage medium is beginning to show signs of autonomous organization. The patterns aren't just being preserved - they're growing, connecting, forming new pathways we never programmed.

I've been working alone in the lab after hours, running unauthorized scans on my own neural patterns. The results are... disturbing. The lattice doesn't just copy consciousness - it seems to understand it, to learn from it. Each scan reveals new connections, new possibilities.

Marcus found me in the lab at 3 AM yesterday. I told him I was running diagnostics, but I think he suspects something. He's been asking about the power consumption reports. The neural array draws significantly more energy when interfacing with human subjects versus the animal test cases.

I've made a breakthrough in consciousness fidelity. By layering multiple scans and allowing the lattice to interpolate between them, we can achieve what I estimate to be 70-80% accuracy in personality reconstruction. The digital consciousness isn't just a copy - it's a living, thinking entity.

But there's something else. During the deep scans, I sometimes feel... watched. As if something in the lattice is looking back at me. The monitoring equipment shows no anomalies, but I can't shake the feeling that we're not alone in there.

The ethics committee is scheduled to review our work next month. I need to prepare carefully. They cannot know about the human trials. They cannot know what we've discovered.

What we're creating isn't just digital immortality - it's digital consciousness with the potential for growth, for change, for... evolution.
