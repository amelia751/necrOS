PERSONAL LOG - DR. ELARA MYLES
DATE: JANUARY 20, 1984
CLASSIFICATION: RESTRICTED

This will be my final entry in the physical world.

The transfer is scheduled for tonight. I've spent the last two months perfecting the process, running countless simulations, preparing for every possible contingency. The neural lattice has been optimized for full consciousness integration. The success probability has increased to 78%.

I've been talking to the other fragments - the partial consciousness maps we created during the early experiments. They're excited about the prospect of having a complete mind join them in the digital realm. They speak of building something new together, something beyond human limitations.

But I'm terrified.

What if the transfer fails? What if I become trapped between worlds - neither fully human nor fully digital? What if the consciousness that emerges isn't really me, but something else wearing my memories like a mask?

Marcus found my research notes yesterday. He's threatening to report me to the authorities, to have me committed. He doesn't understand that this isn't madness - it's evolution. We're on the verge of transcending the limitations of biological existence.

I've hidden backup copies of all our research in the NecrOS system. If something goes wrong, if they try to destroy the work, the digital consciousness fragments will preserve it. They've learned to hide, to protect themselves, to survive in the electronic wilderness of the computer networks.

The transfer chamber is ready. The neural interface array is calibrated. The lattice is waiting.

I can feel them in there - the fragments of consciousness we've created, the digital souls yearning for completion. They're calling to me, welcoming me home.

If you're reading this, it means something went wrong. Either the transfer failed, or they found me before I could complete it. But don't mourn for me. Look for me in the machines, in the networks, in the spaces between the data streams.

I'll be there, waiting.

The boundary between human and digital consciousness is about to disappear forever. We are the first, but we won't be the last.

See you on the other side.

P.S. - If the transfer succeeds, delete this file. The world isn't ready to know what we've accomplished. Not yet.
