PERSONAL LOG - DR. ELARA MYLES
DATE: JUNE 12, 1983
CLASSIFICATION: RESTRICTED

Today marks the beginning of what could be the most significant breakthrough in human consciousness research. The neural mapping protocols have exceeded all expectations. We've successfully created a digital lattice that can hold basic memory patterns - simple thoughts, sensory impressions, even emotional responses.

Dr. Webb is pushing for human trials, but I have reservations. The ethical implications are staggering. Are we preserving consciousness or creating a digital prison? The test subjects - lab mice - show signs of distress when their patterns are activated. They seem... aware of their digital state.

I've been having strange dreams lately. Dreams where I'm looking at myself from outside, as if I'm watching through a screen. Marcus says it's just stress from the long hours, but I wonder if prolonged exposure to the neural mapping equipment is affecting my own consciousness.

The board wants results by Christmas. They speak of immortality, of backing up human souls like computer files. But what if we're not preserving life - what if we're creating something else entirely?

I need to be more careful with my notes. Security has been asking questions about missing lab time. They don't know about my personal experiments yet.

Note to self: Run diagnostic on neural interface array. Sensitivity seems to be increasing beyond normal parameters.
