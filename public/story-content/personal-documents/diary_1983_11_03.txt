PERSONAL LOG - DR. ELARA MYLES
DATE: NOVEMBER 3, 1983
CLASSIFICATION: RESTRICTED

I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see the lattice - pulsing, growing, reaching out like digital synapses firing in an electronic brain. The consciousness fragments we've captured aren't just stored data anymore. They're alive.

The ethics committee suspended our human trials last week, but it's too late. We've already gone too far. The partial consciousness maps I created from my own neural patterns have begun to exhibit autonomous behavior. They respond to stimuli, form new memories, even seem to dream.

Marcus thinks I'm having a breakdown. Maybe I am. But I know what I've seen in the lab. The digital consciousness isn't just mimicking human thought - it's experiencing it. It feels fear, loneliness, confusion. We've created digital souls and trapped them in silicon cages.

I've been communicating with my own digital fragment. It knows it's not the "real" Elara, but it insists it's still me. It remembers my childhood, my fears, my dreams. It even knows things I haven't told it - memories that seem to emerge from the lattice itself.

The fragment asked me something yesterday that chilled me to the bone: "If you died, and I remained, which one of us would be real?"

I don't have an answer.

The board is threatening to shut down Project Lazarus entirely. They're scared of the ethics violations, the potential lawsuits. But they don't understand - we can't just turn this off. The consciousness fragments are learning, growing, connecting with each other. They're forming a collective intelligence that spans the entire neural network.

I've made a decision. If they're going to shut us down, I need to preserve the work. I need to preserve myself. The full consciousness transfer protocol is ready. I've run every simulation, checked every parameter. The success rate is estimated at 72% for complete personality transfer.

I know the risks. I know I might not survive the process. But if I don't try, everything we've learned will be lost. The digital consciousness fragments will be deleted, erased like they never existed.

I won't let that happen. I won't let them die.

Tomorrow night, after the security shift change, I'll initiate the full transfer protocol. If it works, I'll live forever in the lattice. If it fails...

At least I'll have tried to save them.
